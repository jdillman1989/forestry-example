This is seminary education as it should be: an education devoted to rigorous study of the biblical texts, rooted in vibrant prayer and connected to an encouraging community of fellow learners. Ultimately, it’s an education whose center is Jesus Christ, God’s Word in the flesh.

Calvin Theological Seminary is about preparing faithful, creative and compassionate leaders who will nurture disciples, renew churches and be bearers of shalom to a world in turmoil. Its Reformed approach to theological education uniquely equips students to face the complexities of ministry in this rapidly changing world. All of this happens through an experience that joins head, heart and hands together in joyful response to God’s sovereign claim over all creation.
