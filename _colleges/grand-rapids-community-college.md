Grand Rapids is part of our name, but so is “community,” and the community we serve deserves the best from its community college. And while we all recognize our local city, town, and county boundaries, those distinctions are being melded into the West Michigan community. We are evolving — and it’s a good evolution. One college, many communities — that’s how we work.

A century ago, we started in one building. Now we have a campus on the lakeshore, as well as satellite sites in Grandville, Rockford, Lowell, and Caledonia. A recent economic impact report found that in 2015-16 GRCC added $413.5 million to the Kent County economy and $34.2 million to Ottawa County's economy. This year, we will serve more than 29,500 students and for each of those individuals who finds a place in our state’s educated workforce, prosperity follows for our community.
