We're the first choice of students from throughout Michigan and across the country. Our academic excellence, engaged faculty, and great return on investment create an unmatched educational experience. That's the Laker Effect and we want you to be part of it.

More than 25,000 students have chosen to study at Grand Valley, making us one of the largest universities in Michigan. We're big enough to have the impact of a major university and small enough to give you the support and resources you need to move forward and succeed.
